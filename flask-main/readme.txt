The code works feathers in python 2.7

The 3 scripts work together so they should run together.

Run the extserver.py
Then the xsite.py
And finally the client.py

Data transfer occurs in sequence

Ports can be configured in the script: xconfig.py

It will not work if ip is used (0.0.0.0). * Unfortunately it is only possible to run the scripts on the same machine *
